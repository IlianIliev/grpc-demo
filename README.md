## Generating the protobuf file

Note: This command need only the `protobuf` package to be installed 

`protoc -I=./proto ./proto/proto.proto --python_out=./proto_test`


## Generating the grpc files
Run the following command

`python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./proto --python_out=./proto_test --grpc_python_out=./proto_test ./proto/proto.proto`

It generates two files:
 - `proto_pb2.py` - contains information regarding the serialization of the messages defined in the proto file. Same as the file generated by the `protoc` command above.
 - `proto_pb2_grpc.py` - contains the base information and methods for registering the service 

## How to run
1. Start the server - `python proto_test/server.py`
2. Run the client example - `python proto_test/client_example.py`


## Warning
This code should be used only as an introduction example of how to build gRPC server and client. In several places (e.g. data storage) the code is oversimplified and should not be used on production.
